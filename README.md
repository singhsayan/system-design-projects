# System Design Projects  

This repository contains **scalable, high-performance system designs** focused on real-world applications. Each project follows a **modular architecture**, emphasizing **efficiency, reliability, and fault tolerance**.  

## Projects  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Gmail-Service System Design**  
A **scalable email system** designed for **performance, security, and high availability**.  
- **Key Components:** API Gateway, Mail Processing, Storage, Search.  
- **Optimized Storage:** SQL-based with indexing for fast retrieval.  
- **Trade-offs:** Rate limiting, caching strategies, and service management.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Distributed Weather App**   
A **highly scalable, real-time weather forecasting system** designed using a **microservices architecture**.  
- **Key Components:** Gateway Service, Service Manager, Weather Data Services (Temperature, Wind, Humidity), Notifications.  
- **Data Storage:** SQL for user profiles and notifications, NoSQL for real-time weather data.  
- **Performance Optimization:** Kafka for asynchronous messaging, Redis for caching, and Kubernetes for container orchestration.  
- **Observability:** Integrated **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for real-time monitoring and alerting.  

## Tech Stack  
I use a combination of **highly scalable technologies** tailored to each project, including:  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **Database:** SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis)  
- **Messaging & Caching:** Kafka, Redis  
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, Load Balancing, Prometheus, Grafana  
- **Networking:** API Gateway, Rate Limiting  

## About Me
