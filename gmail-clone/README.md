Gmail Service Design
Gmail-Service System Design

Overview

A scalable and efficient email system designed for high performance, security, and availability. It supports sending, receiving, and managing emails while handling millions of users reliably.

Key Features

Email Management – Send, receive, and organize emails.
Scalability – Load balancing, replication, and optimized indexing.
Fast Search – Indexed emails for quick retrieval.
Security – Authentication, encryption, and rate limiting.
High Availability – Redundant storage and backup strategies.
High-Level Design (HLD)

Architecture Components
API Gateway – Handles user requests.
Mail Processing Service – Manages email sending, receiving, and storage.
Storage Service – SQL-based database for emails and user data.
Search Service – Indexes emails for efficient searches.
Notification Service – Sends alerts for new emails.
More details: See HLD.pdf.

Low-Level Design (LLD)

Key Design Aspects
Class Diagrams – Defines entities like User, Email, Attachment, and Folder.
Sequence Diagrams – Outlines request flow for email operations.
Database Schema – SQL schema optimized with indexing.
More details: See LLD.pdf.

Capacity Estimation

Designed to handle millions of emails daily with:

Storage – SQL-based with optimized indexing.
Bandwidth – Efficient data transfer using compression.
Compute Resources – Horizontally scaled backend services.
More details: See Capacity-Estimation.md.

Trade-offs and Design Decisions

Rate Limiting Strategy
Token Bucket chosen over Leaky Bucket for better burst handling.
Per-user rate limiting to prevent abuse.
Service Manager Trade-offs
Centralized Service Manager for easier monitoring.
Failover mechanisms to prevent a single point of failure.
Redis Trade-offs
Lazy Loading (Cache-aside) for better performance.
Hybrid Persistence:
RDB (Snapshotting) for efficient backups.
AOF (Append-Only File) for durability.
More details: See Tradeoffs.md.

Scaling Strategy

Load Balancing – Distributes traffic efficiently.
Database Replication – Ensures availability and fault tolerance.
Indexing – Improves search performance.
More details: See Scaling-Strategy.md.

Deployment Strategy

Docker – Containerized for portability.
Virtual Machines (VMs) – Traditional deployment with manual configurations.
More details: See Deployment-Strategy.md.

Monitoring and Logging

Logging – Tracks errors and requests.
Server Monitoring – Monitors CPU and memory usage.
More details: See Monitoring-Logging.md.

Security Considerations

Authentication – Secure login with encrypted passwords.
Rate Limiting – Prevents excessive API requests.
Data Encryption – Emails encrypted during storage and transmission.
More details: See Security-Considerations.md.

Conclusion

A scalable, highly available, and secure email system with a modular architecture and SQL-based storage. This design ensures performance, reliability, and fault tolerance at an enterprise level.
