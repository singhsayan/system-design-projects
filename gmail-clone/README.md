Gmail-Service System Design

Overview

I designed the Gmail-Service to be a scalable and efficient email system that allows users to send, receive, and manage emails reliably. The system follows a well-structured, modular architecture with a focus on performance, security, and availability.

Features
	1.	Email Management – Users can send, receive, and organize emails.
	2.	Scalability – Designed to handle a large number of concurrent users with load balancing and replication.
	3.	Search Optimization – Emails are indexed for fast retrieval.
	4.	Security – Encryption, authentication, and rate limiting for protection.
	5.	High Availability – Redundant storage and backup strategies for reliability.

High-Level Design

The architecture follows a modular service-based approach to ensure maintainability and performance. Key components include:
	•	API Layer – Handles user requests and routes them to backend services.
	•	Mail Processing Service – Manages email sending, receiving, and storage.
	•	Storage Service – Uses a relational database (SQL) for storing emails and user data.
	•	Search Service – Indexes emails for efficient retrieval.
	•	Notification Service – Sends notifications for new emails.

The HLD.pdf file provides further details on architectural components and interactions.

Low-Level Design

The system is implemented using structured class-based programming with well-defined services. It includes:
	•	Class Diagrams – Defining core entities like User, Email, Attachment, and Folder.
	•	Sequence Diagrams – Outlining request flow for email operations.
	•	Database Schema – SQL-based schema optimized with indexing and normalization.

The LLD.pdf file contains a detailed breakdown of these design aspects.

Capacity Estimation

To handle millions of emails daily, I designed the system with:
	•	Storage – SQL-based relational database with optimized indexing.
	•	Bandwidth – Efficient data transmission using compression.
	•	Compute Resources – Horizontally scaled backend services.

More details are available in the Capacity-Estimation.md file.

Trade-offs

I considered multiple trade-offs while designing the system:
	1.	Rate Limiting Strategy
	•	Token Bucket vs. Leaky Bucket: I chose the Token Bucket approach as it provides better burst handling, allowing short-term high loads while still controlling the request rate.
	•	Global vs. Per-User Rate Limiting: A per-user rate limiting strategy ensures fair usage while preventing individual abuse.
	2.	Service Manager Trade-off
	•	Centralized vs. Decentralized Service Management:
	•	A centralized service manager makes monitoring and control easier but introduces a single point of failure.
	•	A decentralized approach offers better fault tolerance but is more complex.
	•	I opted for a centralized service manager with failover mechanisms to balance control and availability.
	3.	Redis Trade-off
	•	Caching Strategy:
	•	Write-Through Caching ensures consistency but increases write latency.
	•	Lazy Loading (Cache-aside) reduces write latency but can lead to stale reads.
	•	I used Lazy Loading for improved performance, with eviction policies to prevent outdated cache entries.
	•	Persistence Considerations:
	•	AOF (Append-Only File) vs. RDB (Snapshotting):
	•	RDB is efficient for backups but may lose recent data in case of failure.
	•	AOF provides durability but increases disk writes.
	•	I combined both (AOF for durability, RDB for snapshots).

More details on these trade-offs are available in the Tradeoffs.md file.

Scaling Strategy

To support large-scale operations, I implemented:
	•	Load Balancing – Distributes traffic efficiently among multiple servers.
	•	Database Replication – Ensures data availability and reliability.
	•	Indexing – Improves search and retrieval performance.

The Scaling-Strategy.md file provides further insights.

Deployment Strategy

The system is deployed using:
	•	Docker for containerization – Ensures portability and consistency.
	•	Manual Deployment on Virtual Machines – Uses traditional deployment without automation.

The Deployment-Strategy.md file contains the full deployment plan.

Monitoring and Logging

To ensure system reliability, I implemented:
	•	Basic Logging Mechanisms – Helps track errors and requests.
	•	Server Monitoring – CPU and memory usage tracking via system logs.

Details are available in the Monitoring-Logging.md file.

Security Considerations

The system follows standard security practices, including:
	•	Authentication – Secure login with encrypted passwords.
	•	Rate Limiting – Prevents excessive API requests.
	•	Data Encryption – Emails are encrypted during transmission and storage.

The Security-Considerations.md file includes a complete breakdown.

Conclusion

This project focuses on designing a reliable, scalable, and secure email system using a modular architecture with an SQL database. The documentation provides a complete overview of system components, trade-offs, and deployment strategies.
