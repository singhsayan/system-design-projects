# Distributed Weather App  

## Overview ##  

A **scalable, real-time weather forecasting system** designed to provide **high availability, fault tolerance, and low-latency updates**. It efficiently processes and delivers weather data across multiple regions.  

## Key Features ##  

- **Real-time Data Processing** – Fetch, process, and distribute weather updates.  
- **Scalability** – Load balancing, horizontal scaling, and distributed microservices.  
- **Data Aggregation** – Integrates multiple weather data sources for accuracy.  
- **Fault Tolerance** – Redundant data storage and failover strategies.  
- **Event-Driven Architecture** – Uses Kafka for asynchronous message processing.  

## High-Level Design (HLD) ##  

### Architecture Components  
- **API Gateway** – Manages external requests.  
- **Weather Data Service** – Collects and processes real-time weather data.  
- **Storage Service** – SQL for user preferences, NoSQL for time-series weather data.  
- **Notification Service** – Sends alerts based on severe weather conditions.  
- **Service Manager** – Coordinates microservices and handles failover mechanisms.  

📄 **More details:** See **HLD.pdf**.  

## Low-Level Design (LLD) ##  

### Key Design Aspects  
- **Class Diagrams** – Defines entities like WeatherData, User, and Alert.  
- **Sequence Diagrams** – Outlines request flow for fetching and processing weather data.  
- **Database Schema** – Optimized for high-throughput read/write operations.  

📄 **More details:** See **LLD.pdf**.  

## Capacity Estimation ##  

Designed to process **millions of weather data points per day** with:  

- **Storage** – SQL for structured data, NoSQL (MongoDB) for real-time weather logs.  
- **Bandwidth** – Optimized with data compression techniques.  
- **Compute Resources** – Auto-scaled backend services for handling peak traffic.  

📄 **More details:** See **Capacity-Estimation.pdf**.  

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions ##  

### **Message Queue Strategy**  
- **Kafka chosen** over RabbitMQ for better throughput.  
- **Partitioning strategy** to ensure load balancing across consumers.  

### **Service Management Trade-offs**  
- **Decentralized orchestration** with Kubernetes for resilience.  
- **Failover mechanisms** to avoid single points of failure.  

### **Database Trade-offs**  
- **Hybrid SQL-NoSQL approach** for balancing consistency and speed.  
- **Redis caching** for low-latency reads.  

📄 **More details:** See **Tradeoffs.pdf**.  

## Scaling Strategy ##  

- **Load Balancing** – Distributes API traffic efficiently.  
- **Database Replication** – Ensures data availability and fault tolerance.  
- **Sharding** – Optimized storage for handling massive weather datasets.  

📄 **More details:** See **Scaling-Strategy.pdf**.  

## Deployment Strategy ##  

- **Docker** – Containerized for seamless deployment.  
- **Kubernetes** – Orchestrates microservices efficiently.  
- **Cloud-based Deployment** – Supports AWS/GCP for global scalability.  

📄 **More details:** See **Deployment-Strategy.pdf**.  

## Security Considerations ##  

- **Authentication** – Secure API access with OAuth.  
- **Rate Limiting** – Prevents excessive API requests and abuse.  
- **Data Encryption** – Weather data encrypted during storage and transmission.  

📄 **More details:** See **Security-Considerations.pdf**.  

## Conclusion ##  

A **highly scalable, real-time, and fault-tolerant weather forecasting system** built for **performance, reliability, and accuracy**. Designed with a **modular, microservices architecture**, this system efficiently handles **massive data processing workloads** while ensuring **resilience and low-latency delivery**.
